        You just found TipSee.Art and you’re about to make an impact on a local
        artist and this community! You’ve obviously enjoyed the public art
        you’ve just viewed if you’ve scanned the QR code and found us.

        {" "}
        We’re a group of volunteers who are passionate about accessible art in
        our community, and passionate about seeing artists recognized and paid
        for their work! See, TipSee.Art allows you to learn more about the
        artist whose work you just viewed- maybe give them a follow on Instgram
        or check out their website and find a new piece for your walls, but
        also, TipSee.Art provides you an opportunity to <i>pay</i> them for
        their work.{" "}

        Art is work and artists deserve to be recognized for the value they
        bring to our community. TL:DR: TipSee.Art is a way to tip an artist for
        the art you see. Your dollars will go directly to the artist of your
        choosing, in a method that works for you, helping to further their
        practice and allowing them to continue to make their mark on our
        community, for you to enjoy. If you’d buy them a drink, take the leap
        and get TipSee for art.
