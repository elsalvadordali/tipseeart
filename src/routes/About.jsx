          You just found TipSee.Art and you’re about to make an impact on a
          local artist and this community! You’ve obviously enjoyed the public
          art you’ve just viewed if you’ve scanned the QR code and found us.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-8">
          We’re a group of volunteers who are passionate about accessible art in
          our community, and passionate about seeing artists recognized and paid
          for their work! See, TipSee.Art allows you to learn more about the
          artist whose work you just viewed- maybe give them a follow on
          Instgram or check out their website and find a new piece for your
          walls, but also, TipSee.Art provides you an opportunity to{" "}
          <i>
            <em>pay</em>
          </i>{" "}
          them for their work.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-8">
          Art is work and artists deserve to be recognized for the value they
          bring to our community. TL:DR: TipSee.Art is a way to tip an artist
          for the art you see. Your dollars will go directly to the artist of
          your choosing, in a method that works for you, helping to further
          their practice and allowing them to continue to make their mark on our
          community, for you to enjoy. If you’d buy them a drink, take the leap
          and get TipSee for art.
